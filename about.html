    <h2>Who We Are</h2>
    <p>
        UniMove Crew is a student-founded service in Leuven that helps make moving simple. We know from personal experience that carrying heavy furniture, boxes, and belongings into a new place can be stressful — especially for international students arriving alone. That’s why we started UniMove Crew: to provide affordable and reliable moving support from students who understand your needs.
        We focus solely on the moving-in process: carrying boxes, lifting furniture, and setting up your essentials. No trucks, no complicated costs — just dependable manpower to get the job done.
        Our mission is to make move-in day easier while creating flexible work opportunities for students. With UniMove Crew, you get affordable support and the reassurance that someone has your back when it matters most.
        Whether it’s your first day in Leuven or you’re simply changing apartments, we’re here to make your move stress-free.
